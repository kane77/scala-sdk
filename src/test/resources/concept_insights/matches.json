      "abstract": "Measurement is the process or the result of determining the ratio of a physical quantity, such as a length, time, temperature etc. , to a unit of measurement, such as the meter, second or degree Celsius. The science of measurement is called metrology. The English word measurement originates from the Latin mēnsūra and the verb metiri through the Middle French mesure.",

Time is a component quantity of many measurements used to sequence events, to compare the durations of events and the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience.",

It is used principally as a unit of weight, and as a unit of volume. It can also be used as a measure of energy, for truck classification, or as a colloquial term. It is derived from the tun, the term applied to a barrel of the largest size.",

Any other value of the physical quantity can be expressed as a simple multiple of the unit of measurement. For example, length is a physical quantity. The metre is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length.",

Established standard objects and events are used as units, and the process of measurement gives a number relating the item under study and the referenced unit of measurement. Measuring instruments, and formal test methods which define the instrument's use, are the means by which these relations of numbers are obtained.",
